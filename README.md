# Proof Of MemberShip of Developer DAO

## Working

The zkGraph searches the events in the block for any Transfer Event for D4R NFT or CODE Token and therefore they can prove that they were member at this block and returns the address of the user.

## Usage CLI

> Note: Only `full` image will be processed by zkOracle node. `local` (generated by commands ending with `--local` option) means the zkGraph is compiled locally and only contains partial computation (so that proving and executing will be faster).

The workflow of local zkGraph development must follow: `Develop` (code in /src) -> `Compile` (get compiled wasm image) -> `Execute` (get expected output) -> `Prove` (generate input and pre-test for actual proving in zkOracle) -> `Verify` (verify proof on-chain).

To upload and publish your zkGraph, you should `Upload` (upload code to IPFS), and then `Publish` (register zkGraph on onchain zkGraph Registry).

## Commonly used commands

- **compile**: `npx zkgraph compile`
- **exec**: `npx zkgraph exec <block id>`
- **prove**: ` npx zkgraph prove <block id> <expected state> -i|-t|-p`
